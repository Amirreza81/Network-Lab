# **Network-Lab, Sharif University of Technology** 🌐

This repository contains reports and project implementations developed as part of the *Computer Networks Laboratory* (CE-416) course at **Sharif University of Technology**. The projects focus on the practical aspects of networking concepts and provide hands-on experience with real-world challenges in network design, configuration, and troubleshooting. All simulations and configurations are carried out using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
