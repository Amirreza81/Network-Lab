# **Network-Lab, Sharif University of Technology** 🌐

This repository contains reports and project implementations developed as part of the *Computer Networks Laboratory* (CE-416) course at **Sharif University of Technology**. The projects emphasize practical aspects of networking concepts, providing hands-on experience with real-world challenges in network design, configuration, and troubleshooting. All simulations and configurations are carried out using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, a powerful tool that allows for the creation and testing of virtual networks.

## **Packet Tracer Usage**
Cisco Packet Tracer was used throughout the course to simulate network configurations and analyze network behavior. This software enables us to design complex networks, configure devices, and troubleshoot issues in a virtual environment, enhancing our learning experience.
